DB and core:
    - Change the foreign key from 'users_perks' table to the perk's name, instead of the ID
        - Why?: The perk's name is unique and it will ALWAYS find the corresponding record of the 'perks' table
                No matter if the primary key of 'perks' changes due to new records or reseting, the name won't
